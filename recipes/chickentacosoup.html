    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of the <strong>easiest</strong> recipes to follow. (Bless you, <a
            href="https://togetherasfamily.com/7-can-chicken-taco-soup/">Jessica</a>.) Now that I think about it, I
        don't even use all seven cans! Load it up with sour cream and shredded cheese, give it a good mix, and grab the
        tortilla chips.</p>
    <p><i>*Diced tomatoes have been removed as a personal preference.</i></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can black beans (drained & rinsed)</li>
        <li>1 can pinto beans (drained & rinsed)</li>
        <li><del>1 can petite diced tomatoes</del></li>
        <li>1 can sweet corn (drained)</li>
        <li>1 can (12.5 oz) chicken breast (drained & flaked)</li>
        <li>1 can (10 oz) green enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 packet taco seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p><em>Literally two steps.</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients into a large soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling reduce
            heat to low and let simmer for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Serve with tortilla chips, shredded cheese, sour cream, and avocado!</li>
    </ol>
